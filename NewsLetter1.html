Hi,
<br>
Thank you for subscribing to our mailing list we will be sending a seasonal newsletter (every 2 weeks) and weekly updates about the clan. Starting this season is our new 10 pound voucher giveaway to the best donator and clan war effort. Congratulations to Grimmnall for winning last seasons prize for over 1000 donations and 6 stars in every war!
<br>
<br>
Clan War:
<br>
We have not been winning many clan wars because too many people leave the clan and/or do not attack. This is hard to combat because we can not force people to use their attacks, therefore it is necessary for us to use each attack that remains to get as many stars as possible. War strategies we have lost too involve attacking low to gather easy 3 stars. Also keeping a steady pace and not losing hope too early will help. People who do not participate in clan wars will be kicked.
<br>
<br>
10 Pound Voucher:
<br>
At the end of each season Codper & OLJOAT will chose the person with the best donations and war effort, they will be rewarded with Co-leader and a 10 pound voucher of their choice. From this season on we will keep public records of peoples donations and stars in wars (links will be emailed shortly). Vote on which voucher you would chose <a href="http://strawpoll.me/1857658">here</a>.

<br>
Thanks,
<br>
Codper (KnightHood - Leader)
